    "EFFECT4": "I forgot to alternate with softwares when I felt at the top or at the max. My alcohol level continues to rise, and my ability to make people laugh and enjoy myself is inversely proportional. I am convinced that I am funny and attractive, but I am the only one who thinks so. I speak loudly and post a little about my neighbour, my neighbour. Anyway, I'm heavy... I'm starting to have balance problems. The future will be difficult! I am between 2‰ and 3‰ of alcohol in my blood.",
    "EFFECT5": "It's the phrase that takes everyone... it's the sad, violent alcohol... I no longer manage my consumption at all. I lose control and balance (as well as my wallet, my keys, my mobile,...). My brain is suffering greatly and nausea appears. I don't make anyone laugh anymore. On the contrary, I become a'bitu' to manage. The next day will be very painful and I could regret things, facts. I revolve around the 3‰ of alcohol in my blood, it's much too much!",
    "EFFECT6": "It's pre-coma or ethyl coma. I fall asleep under the influence of alcohol and, without realizing it, I take enormous risks (choking if I vomit, falls and trauma, respiratory arrest which can lead to death). Moreover, if I've ever had another drink or done either'at the bottom', my alcohol level will rise again. The risk of deep coma then becomes very high. I am between 3‰ and 4‰ of alcohol in my blood, most of us go into pre-coma or deep coma at that rate!",
